**1. Describe the data that you would need to collect to build a recommendation system to recommend student loan options for students. Explain why this data would be relevant and appropriate.**



**1)Loan interest rate: This feature will let the student what would be the price of the loan.
2)Terms of repayment: This feature will inform the student when repayment starts and how long will it take
3)Fees: What other fees besides the loan will the student incurr in 
4)Penalties: Montetary consequences for infractions.
5)Bank rating: How do current borrowers rate the bank** 



**2. Based on the data you chose to use in this recommendation system, would your model be using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or context-based filtering? Justify why the data you selected would be suitable for your choice of filtering method.**



**Collaborative filtering is a technique that can filter out items that a user might prefer on the basis of selections by similar users.
In this case the selections of students with similar situation might give the prospective student an intution of what the best options are.



**3. Describe two real-world challenges that you would take into consideration while building a recommendation system for student loans. Explain why these challenges would be of concern for a student loan recommendation system.**

**A good recommender system would pair the student with the most convinient loan. 
Since the size of loan is paramount ascertaining the students financial/academic situatuion to determine which aid programms are available to reduce it is very important. This information varies greatly by location and applicant, making it an enormous task.**

**Not to long ago there was extensive reporting on the predatory practices of institutions which issued student loans so some type of rating scale for them would be beneficial but will take a lot of leg work.
